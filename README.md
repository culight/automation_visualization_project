# American's Automation Predictions

## Summary
Project for Georgia Tech's LMC 3412 (Communicating Science and Technology to the Public). Includes a data visualization that shows how different people in society perceive the influence of automation. I use the Future of Work dataset from Pew Research (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/03/10/public-predictions-for-the-future-of-workforce-automation/)
