# Americans' Automation Predictions

## Summary
This interactive visualization is for my final project in Udacity's "Make Effective Data Visualization" (project 6) course. In the visualization, I tackle the topic of automation in the workplace. The objective of the visualization is to effectively explore how the average American perceives the threat of automation in their workplace and in general. The input data comes from a pew research questionnaire.

## Design
  **Bar graph**: I use bar graphs as a way to compare categorical data
  **Size**: I use size to make relative comparison amongst cohorts (conservative vs. moderate, etc.)
  **Percentages**: Percentages are used(y-axis) to make comparisons between cohorts ("definitely will" vs. "definitely won't")
  **Color hue**: The main bars use a slightly darker color to attract your attention before the children graphs transform
  **Pre-attentive Processing**: Red highlighting is used to both beckon the user to click and also
  to remind them what category they're exploring.
  **Tooltip**: Gives more details about a certain bar
  **Animated Transitions**: Cool to look at

## Feedback
  Here's some feedback that I've received:
  * First thing I noticed were the graphs on the right
  * I wonder how many people were surveyed and where the info came from
  * Not as many people were concerned about job security as I expected
  * Compartmentalization of information was useful
  * I didn't know to click on the bar (*before I added hovering*)

## Future Work
  * Make the content more responsive
  * Optimize the data aggregation algorithm
  * Try to delve deeper into the data on the right side
