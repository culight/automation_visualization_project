# American's Automation Predictions

## Summary
This interactive visualization is for my final project in Udacity's "Make Effective Data Visualization" (project 6) course. In the visulization, I tackle the topic of automation in the workplace. The objective of the visualization is to effectively explore how the average American perceives the threat of automation in their workplace and in general. The input data comes from a pew research questionnaire. (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/03/10/public-predictions-for-the-future-of-workforce-automation/)
